  <h3>About WouldYouRather</h3>

  <p> WYR is a place for users to come and create or view "would you rather" questions. For example: Would you rather fight one horse sized duck,
   or one hundred duck sized horses? You can create your own posts, or you can simply veiw other peoples posts. When veiwing other peoples posts,
   you have the option of voting on which you would rather do. If you vote for the option that has the majority of the votes, then you get a point.
  You can also get points from people liking your posts, so the better the question, the more points you'll get. Can you make it on to the leaderboard?
